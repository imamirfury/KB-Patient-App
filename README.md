## ðŸ§± Project Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture combined with:

- **Jetpack Compose** for UI.
- **Room** for local data storage.
- **Hilt** for dependency injection.
- **Coroutines & Flows** for asynchronous operations.
- **Repository pattern** for data abstraction.
- **Offline-first strategy** with support for sync when network is available.

### Layers Breakdown:

- **UI (View)**: Built using Jetpack Compose. Responsive and adaptive layouts for form inputs and summaries.
- **ViewModel**: Contains state management logic using `StateFlow` and `MutableState`.
- **Repository**: Handles data access operations from both local and (mocked) remote sources.
- **Local Data**: Managed with Room, includes Patient and Visit entities.
- **Sync Manager**: Handles logic to sync local data with a remote server when internet is available.
